## Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection & Tracking**: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for instantaneous object detection and tracking.
- **Region-Based Counting**: Performs object counting within a user-defined region, catering to specific analytical needs.
- **Visual Feedback**: Annotates detected objects with bounding boxes, class IDs, and confidence scores.
- **Data Logging**: Compiles all detections into a CSV file for subsequent analysis and reporting.
- **Performance Metrics**: Offers insights into the system's performance, including FPS and processing times.
- **Temporal Visualization**: Graphically represents the object count over time, facilitating trend observation and analysis.
